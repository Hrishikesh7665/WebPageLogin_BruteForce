## How it work?

This tool tries to connect by exploiting the library of passwords that it has in its possession and do not stop to submit the form until it has correspondence, so you can edit the dictionary file txt by adding your own words for a particular target.


## Target Lab:

You can set your own LAB for testing this tool with XAMP by following this steps: 

- Step 1

*Install XAMP*

- Step 2

*Download This PHP Webpage [click here for download](https://test.php)*

- Step 3

Create a new folder with the name 'LoginPage' in 'C:\xampp\htdocs\'

- Step 4

*Copy the 'loginpage.php' file into the 'C:\xampp\htdocs\LoginPage'*

- Step 5

*Visit '127.0.0.1/LoginPage/loginpage.php'*

- Step 6

*Now your test lab is ready. Happy Hacking.*
